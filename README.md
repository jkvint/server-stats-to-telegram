# Server Stats to Telegram (python3)
Pushing your Server Stats (disk space, cpu usage, ram space) as a message to Telegram

1. Just modify the `disktomonitor` parameter and the servername, add your telegram bot token & your telegram id. 
2. Test the script 
3. Put it in a cronjob to report to you as often as you like (I get them with my morning coffee)
